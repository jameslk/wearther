# Wearther

Wearther is a simple web app that gives you the weather and a suggestion of what to
wear for the day in one sentence.

## Goals
- Simplicity - like Google's homepage.
- Graceful degradation - no requirement of JavaScript
- Mobile first

## MVP Target
It guesses the user's location and gives a one-sentence weather report.

## Backlog
- I would like a report for the entire day so that I can be prepared for the morning, afternoon and evening
- I would like to enter a different location so that I can tailor my weather report to my needs
  - It should remember this location with a cookie
- I would like to subscribe to daily emails of weather reports so that I don't have to visit the website
